Hi there!

I’m a geek and developer living in a small town in São Paulo, Brazil.

Experienced in a variety of programming languages like Java, PHP, JavaScript
and Python.

Currently in my first web development job, doing some backend and frontend stuff.
Used to do desktop development before that, mainly with Delphi, VB6 and Java.
I've even made a horrible game already. :P

I also maintain [this](https://cademeubicho.com) website as a side project,
where people can share lost pets or pets available for adoption. It’s open
source and you can find the code at my GitHub account.
